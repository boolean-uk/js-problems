# Plain English Solution
If you list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, you'll get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

1) create a list from 1 - 1000 
2) Go through each number so we are able to check if they are a multiple of 3 and 5.
3) When a number is a multiple of 3 and 5, save these values 
4) create a sum of these values 
5) return the total value
