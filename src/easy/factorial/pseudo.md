# Pseudo Code Solution
Find the product of all positive integers less than or equal to any given number. This is known as the _factorial_ (denoted by _!_):

`5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120`
 
 1) create a function called factorial, enter a paramete
 2) create a for loop, which starts from 1, and allocate a condition to find numbers above 1
 3) assign const with operation of multiplication 
 4) create a return, returning the const
 5) console.log
