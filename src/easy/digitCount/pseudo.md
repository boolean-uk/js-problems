# Pseudo Code Solution


Given a number, count the number of digits. For example:

```text
318 = 3
92563 = 5
4666 = 4
314890 = 6
```
1) create two const, one to enter any number and two, so the num formula can feed through
2) the second const - use function called count which equals 0 
3) use an if statement to return digits
