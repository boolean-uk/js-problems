# Plain English Solution

Initialize a list including the first two Fibonacci numbers which are 1 and 1.
Loop starting from the 3rd number going up until the 100th.
Each time calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by adding up the n-2-th and n-1-th numbers from the list.
When the loop is over, return the list.
