# Plain English Solution

Considering the Roman symbol is given as a string, split the string to an array.
Start by getting the numeral value of the rightest/last Roman symbol of the array and add it to the result.
Compare the previous/left symbol's value with the current value and based on the conversion rules either add or substract that from the result.
Follow this procedure until the values of all the symbols have been processed and then return the result.
