# Plain English Solution

Using this more as a ReadMe file rathen than the solution.

mapInit() ->    Creating the map with increasingly harder monsters as well as higher rewards.

rollDice() ->   Use machine time to create a pseudo-random generating function.

doBluff() ->    Compare random chance with the bluff success rate which is 30%.

doBattle() ->   Based on each monster's difficulty compare its defeat chance with a random chance.

castles() ->    The main function. Use all the functions above to achieve the desired functionality. TLDR: Keep bluffing/fighting monsters until you run out of either lives or rooms.

Note: Not sure if/how the pseudo-random function can be 'improved'.
